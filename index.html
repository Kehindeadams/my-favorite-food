Fresh jute leaves-Ewedu leaves can be bought fresh from a local market or frozen at your local African/Caribbean and parsian/indian stores.
<br>
Water- This only applies for frsh ewedu leaves. You will not need water if you buy the frozen pack. It comes with enough water in each pack.
<br>
Locust bean- I love adding locust bean to my ewedu soup. It gives the soup a very rich, deep flavor. However, you may skip this if you are new to it because it has a pungent smell in it‚Äôs raw form. I also blend this insto the ewedu eaves for my kids so they don‚Äôt see the ‚Äùbeans‚Äù and pick them out. üôÇ
<br>
Crayfish- gives ewedu its rich taste and smell
<br>
Salt and bouillon powder (cube)- A little goes a long way in improving the taste of your ewedu.

        <h2>Beef Stew</h2>
        <p>Trim off any excess fat from the meat. Rinse a couple of times till the water runs clear.
            Place the beef in a large pot. Add the diced onion, bay leaf, curry powder, rosemary, bouillon powder, and salt. Mix well, cover, and leave to cook on medium heat for 10 minutes.
            Add the water stir and continue to cook on medium heat for another 20 minutes or until the meat becomes tender. (Tougher meat cut will require a longer cooking time)
            When the meat is fully cooked use a sieve to separate the meat from the stock. Reserve the stock.
            Blend the tomatoes, onion, bell peppers, scotch bonnet peppers, garlic, tomato paste, and ginger, and set aside.
            In a large pot add the cooking oil on medium heat. Once the oil is hot but not smoking, add the diced onions and cook for about 3 minutes.
            Add the blended pepper-tomato mixture stir, cover, and leave to cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes, occasionally stirring to prevent burning.
            Stir in the beef stock, thyme, curry powder, and bouillon, and continue to cook for another 10 minutes on medium-low heat.
            Add the cooked beef, taste for salt, and adjust as needed. Cover and leave to simmer on low heat for another 5 minutes or until the stew is thickened to your preference.
